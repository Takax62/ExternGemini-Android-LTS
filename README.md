# ExternGemini-Android-LTS
This is the Gemini 2.5 Flash AI in another GUI. Button meanings: **Retry**: creates a new chat (you won't be able to see the previous chats), **Ask AI**: asks Gemini (you'll need to wait for the answers), **Copy**: copies the chat into the clipboard. The AI switcher is a decoration, you can only chat with gemini-2.5-flash. This app may support Android 4.1 and above.
